**Q: Will my salary be reduced in any way during the apprenticeship?**

 No, there will be no deductions. Neither during, nor after the completion of your apprenticeship.

**Q: Will my contract be special in any way because of the apprenticeship?**

No, it will be the same regular contract that any of our employee receives - apprentice or not.

**Q: Is this the same as an intership?**

No. An internship is a short-duration experience, usually seen as a requirement for students in order to graduate. An apprenticeship in HolidayCheck is an opportunity to get better at the craft, and join a team after it.

**Q: I have more questions, where can I get answers?**
